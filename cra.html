<h1>Cranberry Sauce Ingredients</h1>

Believe it or not, this homemade cranberry sauce comes together quickly and easily with just three easy-to-find ingredients. Here's what you'll need:
<ul>
<li>Fresh Cranberries: Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
<li>Sugar: White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
<li>Orange Juice: All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to Make Cranberry Sauce</h1>
It couldn't be easier to make this 3-ingredient cranberry sauce. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

<ul>
<li>Heat orange juice in a saucepan. </li>
<li>Stir in sugar and cook until it dissolves. </li>
<li>Add cranberries and continue cooking, stirring often, until they start to pop.<lli>
